                        Burak was always super easy to deal with. He was polite, attentive and always worked to a very
                        high standard - exactly what I was looking for in a freelancer! He was also dedicated to
                        improving his skills and constantly impressed me with the copy he produced. I would have no
                        hesitation in recommending him to others.</p>
